# forecasting
Overview
This project focuses on forecasting tractor sales using historical data and predictive modeling techniques. The goal is to provide reliable sales projections to assist in business planning, inventory management, and strategic decision-making.

Features
Analyze historical sales data.

Identify seasonal patterns and trends in tractor sales.

Develop and implement predictive models (e.g., time series models, regression models, machine learning models).

Visualize forecasted sales for better understanding and decision-making.

How It Works
Data Collection: Historical tractor sales data is collected and preprocessed for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyze trends, seasonality, and irregularities.

Visualize sales data for better insight.

Model Development:

Train predictive models such as ARIMA, SARIMA, or machine learning models like Random Forest, XGBoost, or LSTMs.

Evaluate the accuracy of models using appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE).

Forecasting:

Generate future sales predictions.

Assess confidence intervals for forecast accuracy.

Visualization: Create charts and graphs for an intuitive understanding of the results.

Project Structure
data/: Contains the sales data files.

notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for EDA and model training.
